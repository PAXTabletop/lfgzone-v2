Super simple POC to get a feel for how Supabase might work out for lfgzone2. Very little thought has been put into data, this is just a technical proof of concept.

https://lfgzone-supabase.netlify.app/

# TODO

- Join BGG Databases
- Hosting / Estimate on Pricing (Rough estimate of $25 / month, but not sure if recent Heroku pricing changes will affect that)

# Instructions

1. Log into the app: https://app.supabase.com/project/uigkxkubglwdgzlfkgmc/sql

# Optional: if you are setting up the database the first time
2. Paste the data from the ddl.sql and data.sql and policies.sql intpo the sql editor

3. cd app, npm install, ng serve
